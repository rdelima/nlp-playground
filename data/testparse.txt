The distinct seasonality of the Northeast’s
climate supports
a diverse natural
landscape adapted
to the extremes of
cold, snowy winters
and warm to hot,
humid summers.
This natural landscape provides the
economic and cultural foundation for many rural
communities, which are largely supported by a
diverse range of agricultural, tourism, and natural
resource-dependent industries (see Ch. 10: Ag &
Rural, Key Message 4). The recent dominant trend
in precipitation throughout the Northeast has
been towards increases in rainfall intensity, with
increases in intensity exceeding those in other
regions of the contiguous United States. Further
increases in rainfall intensity are expected, with
increases in total precipitation expected during
the winter and spring but with little change in the
summer. Monthly precipitation in the Northeast

is projected to be about 1 inch greater for December through April by end of century (2070–2100)
under the higher scenario (RCP8.5).
